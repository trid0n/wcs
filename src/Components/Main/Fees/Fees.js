                accessed through a specialist. All referrals 
                are to be faxed, mailed or emailed  before an 
                appt can be organised. Please contact Suzy to 
                arrange any appointments and she will be able 
                to assist. Contact details can be found on the

You are able to claim up to 10 sessions per calendar 
year under a Mental Health Treatment Plan. The initial 
referral covers you for 6 sessions then another appointment 
is required with your GP to access the last 4.
